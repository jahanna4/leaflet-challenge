# Leaflet Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to visualize data using Leaflet.js.

Data was provided by the United States Geological Survey(USGS). The USGS provides scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The data used for this project consisted of earthquake readings in the United States in a GeoJSON file format.
